I got this <span class="italics">Lanikai Dress</span> from <a href="https://www.milathelabel.com">Mila the Label</a> at their store in Seminyak. Mila the Label has a few locations in Bali (Seminyak, Canggu and Ubud) and they all have super cute pieces! I complimented the dress with a pair of retro sunnies (like <a href="https://rstyle.me/~ar8Dq">these</a> Ray Ban's), which I thought polished off the look.

(The dress is now sold out but <a href="https://rstyle.me/~ar8At">this</a> is an equally-cute alternative from Zulily!)

This <a href="https://www.beachgoldbali.com/collections/dresses/products/faux-riviera-dress-silver">Faux Riviera Dress from Beachgold Bali (in silver)</a> became my go-to casual dress. The material was light, which meant I wasn't dying of heat and it was casual enough for me to wear anywhere.

You can never have enough swimsuits in Bali. I've spent years trying to find a one-piece that fit well before I found the <a href="https://indigoluna.net/collections/one-pieces/products/ava-one-piece-mustard?variant=42263508293">Ava One piece from Indigo Luna</a>. Not only is it super comfortable, but it's also the perfect piece for Instagram. And, did I mention that Indigo Luna uses <a href="https://indigoluna.net/pages/sustainable-practices">recycled materials and all natural dyes</a>? Win, win.

This <a href="https://www.souqstore.co/collections/shop/products/wu-linen-trumpet-sleeve-top-navy-white-stripes">Wu Top</a> is from my all-time favorite store/cafe in Bali, Souq. Located in Seminyak, Souq prides itself on provinding ethically sourced materials and products for their shop and produce and ingredients for their vegetables. They have tons of gorgeous home goods and clothes inspired by the world. And, their cafe has amazing cake (I highly recommend the lemon coconut). For this look, I paired the top with a high-waisted black skirt and a <a href="http://www.kokoonsilks.com/scarf/scarf-guci">head-scarf</a> from <span class="italics">Kookon Silks</span>.

I couldn't have asked for a more perfect Instagram dress than this blue stunner from <a href="http://www.kewangen.com/">Kewangen</a>, a small shop in Ubud. Their store is filled with lots of goodies, but if you can't make it to Ubud <a href="https://www.lulus.com/products/gently-adrift-navy-blue-maxi-dress/355502.html">Adrift Dress from Lulus</a> is also super cute.

I'm a sucker for stripes and when I saw the <span class="italics">Avalon print from Isabella Rose Swimwear</span>, I was obsessed. You can buy the bottoms <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcqj">here</a> and the top <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcqm">here</a>. It also comes in a <a href ="https://rstyle.me/~arcqO">bralette cut</a>, a <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcqR">one-shoulder cut</a> and in a <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcqV">high-waist</a> option.

My ABSOLUTE favorite dress from Bali. I could probably do an entire blog post just of photos of me wearing this dress (like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfyDNltlmhE/?taken-by=samisfierce">this photo</a> of me at <a href="http://opiabali.com/">Opia Bali</a>). This is the <span class="italics">Gaya Maxi Dress</span> from <a href="https://www.milathelabel.com/collections/dresses/products/gaya-maxi-dress">Mila the Label</a>. Sadly, it's now sold out, but this <a href="https://www.palma-australia.com/collections/dresses/products/pm1595-stella-ruffle-maxi-dress-2">Stella Ruffle Maxi Dress</a> is a great alternative from Palma Autralia (which also has a shop in Bali).

When you go to Bali, you have to bring an "Instagram Dress". And this <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcM4">yellow high-low piece</a> from <span class="italics">Shein</span> is actually magical. The fabric is light so it flows easily - and did I mention it's less than $30? I KNOW. I'm thinking about getting another one.

<img src="/images/blogposts/20180423/samisfierce-palma-australia.jpg">
I discovered <span class="italics">Palma Australia</span> while I was in Bali and it didn't take me long to fall in love with their effortlessly feminine cuts. I basically lived in the <a href="https://www.palma-australia.com/collections/tops/products/pm1570-lollia-top">Lollia Top</a> and <a href="https://www.palma-australia.com/collections/bottoms/products/pm1591-stella-short">Stella Shorts</a>.

<img src="/images/blogposts/20180423/samisfierce-socialite.jpeg">
I actually discovered <span class="italics">Socialite Clothing</span> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/socialiteclothing/">Instagram</a> and immediately obsessed over their <a href="https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/socialite-lace-overlay-romper/4980314?origin=keywordsearch-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=BURGUNDY%20GINGER">Lace Overlay Romper</a> (yes it's a romper!!). The lace made it romantic and feminine, but still light - the perfect date-night outfit for Bali (or anywhere tbh). PS it also comes in <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcBE">pink</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcBH">gray</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcBL">green</a>,<a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcBP">ivory</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcC8">yellow</a>, <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcCc">fuchsia</a>,<a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcD5">teal</a> and <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcD7">coral</a>.

I think it's safe to say that <a href="https://baliboatshed.com/">Bali Boat Shed</a> is a Bali staple. Located in Seminyak (underneath<a href="https://www.neonpalms.com/">Neon Palms</a>), this shop is filled with loads of colorful pieces. I loved almost everything from their shop, but specifically obsessed over this floral two-piece set. It's not online yet, but once it is, I'll be sure to update with a link!

<img src="/images/blogposts/20180423/samisfierce-asha-the-label.jpg">
This dress from <a href="https://ashaboutique.com.au/">Asha the Label</a> was another one of my insta-favorites. The dress was extremely light weight, had a fantastic leg slit and a gorgeous open-back. Unfortunately, it was from last season and is no longer being sold on the Asha website, but I've seen an extremely similar design on <a href="https://rstyle.me/~arcPO">Milanoo</a>. I've never bought anything from their site before though - so shop at your own risk.

What look is your favorite? Are there any cool shops in Bali that I missed? I'd love to hear your thoughts below!
