I'll be the first to admit: thinking of instagram captions is really hard. How many times can you say 'Getting my vitamin sea' before your followers start rolling their eyes? Answer: less than once. When I can't think of a witty caption (which is more often than not), I tend to go with a travel quote and I thought you guys might find them helpful too!  

> “Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.”
* Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky

>“Surely, of all the wonders of the world, the horizon is the greatest.”
* Freya Stark

>“I was an adventurer, but she was not an adventuress. She was a 'wanderess.' Thus, she didn’t care about money, only experiences - whether they came from wealth or from poverty, it was all the same to her.”
* Roman Payne, The Wanderess

>“They say no land remains to be discovered, no continent is left unexplored. But the whole world is out there, waiting, just waiting for me. I want to do things-- I want to walk the rain-soaked streets of London, and drink mint tea in Casablanca. I want to wander the wastelands of the Gobi desert and see a yak. I think my life's ambition is to see a yak. I want to bargain for trinkets in an Arab market in some distant, dusty land. There's so much. But, most of all, I want to do things that will mean something.”
* Lisa Ann Sandell, A Map of the Known World

>"Gradually the magic of the island settled over us as gently and clingingly as pollen.”

* From Bali – The Rebirth

>“Certainly, travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living.”
* Miriam Beard

>“The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.”
* Christopher McCandless

>"We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes hand learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate.

And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.”
* Pico Iyer

>“A journey, after all, neither begins in the instant we set out, nor ends when we have reached our door step once again.

Indeed, there exists something like a contagion of travel, and the disease is essentially incurable.”
* Ryszard Kapuściński, Travels with Herodotus

>“I had a desire to see something besides my own shores, if only to be content to return to them someday. If I wish to live in my native land and love her, it should not be out of ignorance.”

* Eric Weiner

>“Do not stop thinking of life as an adventure. You have no security unless you can live bravely, excitingly, imaginatively, unless you can choose a challenge instead of a competence.”
* Eleanor Roosevelt

>“For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel’s sake. The great affair is to move.”
* Robert Louis Stevenson

>"All the above is, of course, a gross simplification. There are deeper reasons to travel – itches and tickles on the underbelly of the unconscious mind. We go where we need to go, and then try to figure out what we’re doing there.”

> We need the tonic of wildness...At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be indefinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable. We can never have enough of nature.
* Henry David Thoreau, Walden: Or, Life in the Woods

>"Wandering is the activity of the child, the passion of the genius; it is the discovery of the self, the discovery of the outside world, and the learning of how the self is both "at one with" and "separate from" the outside world. These discoveries are as fundamental to the soul as "learning to survive" is fundamental to the body. These discoveries are essential to realizing what it means to be human. To wander is to be alive."
* Roman Payne, Europa: Limited Time Edition

I can do anything I want
and be anyone I want

and still call it home
