  Sometimes you just need some time away with your girls. My besties and I were craving some fun in the sun and there's no where better than South Beach!

It’s a well known fact that every girl needs a getaway with her gal pals once in awhile. And, I’m no different. So when a friend called me last week to see if I wanted to go to Miami, I immediately booked my flight with <a href="https://flyskyhi.com/invited/samisfierce" target="blank">SkyHi</a> from ORD to MIA (and for only $75!!). As soon as I landed in Miami, I bee-lined it to South Beach, where we spent the most of our girls trip. I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere, colors and, of course, weather in South Beach. We had such a fun weekend, it was the perfect girls getaway!

<h2>When we went:</h2>
September (3-7)
Since we were visiting during shoulder season, I was a bit worried that we’d see a lot of stormy weather. Fortunately, we got lucky. With the exception of one dreary afternoon, the rest of our trip was filled with sunshine. We also went right after Labor Day, so it was a little quieter than we anticipated.

<a href="http://loews.io/samisfierce" target="blank">The Loews Miami Beach</a> is a  gorgeous hotel in the heart of South Beach. They have an amazing pool, five restaurants (there’s nothing better than ordering cocktails and tacos poolside) and an Exhale Spa (perfect for an early morning yoga detox). When we arrived, the hotel surprised us with a mojito kit and snacks - it was the perfect way to kick off our trip. The Loews Miami Beach has FIVE restaurants and I highly recommend visiting Lure during happy hour - they have dollar oysters and a lot of yummy cocktails for only $8.

<h2>Where We Sunned:</h2>

Not only does <a href="http://loews.io/samisfierce" target="blank">The Loews Miami Beach</a> have a gorgeous pool (see the first image here) they also direct beach access, with chairs, umbrellas and, best of all - bar service. We spent our days lounging on the beach while sipping pina coladas. Can you think of anything more blissful? Tbh, I can't.

<h2>Where We Ate:</h2>

There are so many delicious restaurants in Miami, it was hard to pick places to go! I know I mentioned that Lure has a fantastic happy hour (seriously, check it out) and Bar Collins at<a href="http://loews.io/samisfierce" target="blank">The Loews Miami Beach</a> has FANTASTIC sweet potato fries. If you venture off the hotel property, I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bird-and-bone-miami-beach" target="blank">Bird & Bone</a> (I’d personally recommend the sweet potato pancakes, pictured above) or <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/orange-blossom-miami-beach?osq=Breakfast+%26+Brunch" target="blank">Orange Blossom</a> (which has bottomless brunch, Nutella French Toast and Huevos Rancheros) for breakfast. For the non-breakfast meals, we loved <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/havana-1957-miami-beach-9?osq=Restaurants" target="blank">Havana 1957</a> (how can you go to Miami and not eat Cuban?), <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/naked-taco-miami-beach?osq=Restaurants" target="blank">Naked Taco</a> (an inexpensive taco place, perfect for drinking and eating and more drinking), <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/dirt-miami" target="blank">DIRT</a> (I promise it’s not dirty but a really cool vegan/vegetarian spot) and my all-time favorite, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-stone-crab-miami-beach" target=blank">Joe’s Stone Crab</a>, although a bit pricier, Joe's is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.

<h2>Where We Pampered:</h2>

What's a girls trip without a little pampering? Since we stayed at <a href="http://loews.io/samisfierce" target="blank">The Loews Miami Beach</a> hotel, we took full advantage of the Exhale Spa. I went to Glam + Go (which is located within Exhale) and got an Express Blowout while my girlfriends opted for mani-pedis. While we were getting done up, we were treated to rose and lots of laughs. It was the perfect way to kick off our girls night out.

<h2>Where We Drank:</h2>

I’d be lying if I said we didn’t hang out at the hotel bars an embarrassingly large amount of time (did you not read about the Lure Happy Hour above?), but we also ventured out quite a bit. We had espresso martini’s at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-tavern-miami-beach" target="blank">The Tavern</a>, marveled at the decor at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/broken-shaker-miami-miami-beach?osq=Restaurants" target="blank">Broken Shaker</a>, pretended we were locals at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/employees-only-miami-beach" target="blank">Employee’s Only</a> and enjoyed the views at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lido-bayside-grill-miami-beach" target="blank">Lido</a>. There are so many great places to drink and have a good time in Miami, you really can’t go wrong anywhere you go!

<h2>Where We Went Out:</h2>

<div></div>
Is it really a trip to South Beach without at least one night that ends in walking home at sunrise? I don’t think so. For our crazy night out (as late-twenty-somethings anything past 11pm is a crazy night), we went <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/liv-miami-beach-4" target="blank">Liv</a> and had a great time. Other great nightclubs in the city are: Basement, Story and Rockwell. Fun fact: if you’re a girl, Miami is basically like Vegas, you don’t have to pay to get in, for drinks or bottle service. There are promoters scouring the beaches, bars and instagram, so it’s pretty easy to get a connection to where you want to go!

<h2>Off the Beachy Path:</h2>

We spent one afternoon off the beach and ended up in Wynwood. We had dinner at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/wynwood-kitchen-and-bar-miami" target="blank">Wynwood Kitchen (an awesome spot right next to Wynwood Walls with healthy small plates, highly recommend the burrata), checked out the murals at Wynwood Walls and stopped by <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-wynwood-yard-miami?osq=the+yard" target="blank">Wynwood Yard</a> (an outdoor area with a bar, food trucks and live music). There is so much to do in this area, I’ll definitely have to go back.
