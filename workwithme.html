<h2>Who I am</h2>
<div class="small-space"></div>
<p>Hey, I’m Sam. I’m a Chicago based travel, fashion and lifestyle influencer. Before quitting my job to travel the world, I worked at several large advertising agencies across a variety of accounts including Carnival Cruise Corp, Discover Card, Toyota and Revlon. I recently had an affair with entrepreneurship which allowed me to become a trusted voice in the travel, tech and startup communities.</p>
<p>Combined, these experiences have enabled me to become an effective marketing partner for brands today. I use my experiences and my creative passion to develop data-driven strategies and high quality content for my clients that drive engagement and reach. My skills include: photography, writing, campaign creation and social media marketing. I love working with brands to create data-driven strategies that accomplish traffic and conversion goals.</p>
